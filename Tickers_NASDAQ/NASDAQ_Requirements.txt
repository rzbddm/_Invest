I want to select a .csv file and parse it from the location in quotes, "C:\Users\a_h_J\OneDrive\Documents\_Invest\Tickers_NASDAQ". I want to use Visual Studio Code for python. I want to have a dialog box that asks me to select a .csv file to be parsed. The file name will start with nasdaq_screener. Once the file is selected, I want to remove all rows that are blank in the column labeled Industry. Delete columns with a heads of Last Sale, Net Change, and % Change. Delete columns labeled Market Cap, Country, IPO Year, Volumne. I also want to autofit the contents of the .csv file.  Once this parsing operation is complete, save the file as NASDAQ_YYYY-MM-dd_hhmm.csv, where YYYY is the year, MM is the month, dd is the day, hh is the 24 hour military time hours and mm are the minutes. Be sure to save the file in the same directory as the python file. The name of the python file will parse_csv.py. Change the name of Sheet1 to NASDAQ. 

Add a Sheet2 and call it Industrials, Sheet3 can call it Real Estate, Sheet4 and call it Finance, Sheet5 and call it Health Care, Sheet6 and call it Consumer Discretionary, Sheet7 and call it Technology, Sheet8 and call it Basic Materials, Sheet9 and call it Consumer Staples, Sheet10 and call it Energy, Sheet11 and call it Miscellaneous, Sheet12 and call it Utilities, Sheet13 and call it Telecommunications. For each Sheet from Sheet2 through Sheet13, place the name of the sheet in Column A, cell 1. Next count the number of times the Sheet name appears in Sheet1 Column C and place it in Sheet2 Column B, cell 1. in other words, Industrials appears how many times in column C of Sheet1 and place that number in Column B, Cell 1 for the sheet named Industrials counting from the start of the Sector column in Sheet1 until the end of that column. Do this for the remaining sheets called Real Estate, Finance, Health Care, Consumer Discretionary, Technology, Basic Materials, Consumer Staples, Energy, Miscellaneous, Utilities, Telecommunications.
   
Next copy all rows that have Industrials on sheet1, column C2 through C6666 and paste them into the data sheet Sheet2 starting in row 10. Repeat this with the remaining Sectors on Sheet1, column C into the same data sheet names.  

All sheets except for Sheet1 has the same header on rows 1 and 2. Only show the header in row 1.  Delete row 2 in all sheets except for Sheet1.

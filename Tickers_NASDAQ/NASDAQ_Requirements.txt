I want to select a .csv file and parse it from the location in quotes, "C:\Users\a_h_J\OneDrive\Documents\_Python_VS\Tickers_NASDAQ". I want to use Visual Studio Code for python. I want to have a dialog box that asks me to select a .csv file to be parsed. Once the file is selected, I want to remove all rows that have a Y in the column under the heading of ETF. Under the column heading called Financial Status remove all rows that have a D, E, or H. Delete the column with a heading of NextShares. Delete the column with a heading of ETF. Delete the column with a heading of Round Lot Size. Delete the column with the heading of Test Issue. I also want to autofit the contents of the .csv file. Once this parsing operation is complete, save the file as NASDAQ_YYYY-MM-dd_hhmm.csv, where YYYY is the year, MM is the month, dd is the day, hh is the 24 hour military time hours and mm are the minutes. Be sure to save the file in the same directory as the python file. The name of the python file will parse_csv.py.
